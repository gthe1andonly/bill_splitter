### Bill Splitter
## Have you ever gone out with a bunch of friends and had dinner?
## You all have a wonderful time and then the waiter comes around with your check.
## There's about 10 of you and the waiter has been very nice to you. You don't want
## to make their life miserable so a sorry soul amongst your friends takes out his/her
## wallet and pays the tab. That sorry soul now has to spend time tallying up who got 
## what so he/she can ask every to venmo/zelle/cashapp/applepay/IOU you get the deal.

## This certainly doesn't NEEEEEEDDD an app to solve it and someone has probably 
## already done this but f it. Did I look to see if this app exist? No. Is it more 
## polished than this one will be? Maybe but why are you reading this and asking stupid
## questions? You have better things to do. smh. Enjoy bill splitter!
